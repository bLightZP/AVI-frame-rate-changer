 AVI Frame Rate Changer v1.10 by [bLight].
-------------------------------------------

This program will allow you to alter the
frame rate of a previously created
AVI file.

Just press the browse button and open an
AVI file, if the current frame rate seems
weird, DO NOT apply new frame rates or
you may ruin the AVI file.

You can also open files by passing them
as a parameter.
